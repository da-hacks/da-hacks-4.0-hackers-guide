# Judging & Criteria

## üèÜ How Judging Works
To be judged, you'll need to submit your project on [Devpost](https://dahacks4.devpost.com/). On Devpost, give all the information about your project, including your team. In order to win a prize, you must be physically present during judging to demo your project to the judges.

You'll have up to 5 minutes (3 min demo + 2 min Q&A) to present to the judges, so keep your demo concise, clear, and functional. Slides are okay, but focus on showing your product. Hackathons are about building and learning so you 100% should still demo even if your project isn't finished.

Finally, the top teams will be announced and present at our closing ceremonies, where they will demo for everyone.

## Judging Criteria

- **Application Feasibility**: How well does it work in the real world&trade; ü§î?
- **Functionality & Quality**: Is it useful? Does it work?
- **Creativity & Innovation**: How original is it? Does it go so far outside the box, it literally breaks the box?
- **Technical Complexity**: How complex is it?
- **Presentation**: How well is the project presented? Is the user interface clear and visually appealing?
