# Beginner's Guide to VS Code & AI Editors

**Why Visual Studio Code (VS Code)?**

VS Code is the foundation of modern web development. It works on every OS, supports every language, and defines the standard for what a code editor should look like. However, in 2025, the landscape has shifted toward AI-Native editors that are built on top of VS Code.

## 📥 Installation

### Windows
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the **"Download for Windows"** button
3. Run the downloaded installer (`.exe` file)
4. Follow the installation wizard (you can accept all default options)
5. Launch VS Code from the Start menu

### macOS
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the **"Download for Mac"** button
3. Open the downloaded `.zip` file
4. Drag **Visual Studio Code** to your **Applications** folder
5. Launch VS Code from Applications or Spotlight

### Linux
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the **"Download .deb"** or **"Download .rpm"** button (depending on your distribution)
3. Install using your package manager:
   - **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo dpkg -i code_*.deb && sudo apt-get install -f`
   - **Fedora/RHEL**: `sudo rpm -ivh code-*.rpm`
4. Launch VS Code from your applications menu

## 🎯 Basic Features

### Opening a Folder/Project
1. Click **File → Open Folder** (or press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+K Cmd+O` on Mac)
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Click **Select Folder**

### Creating a New File
- Click the **New File** icon in the Explorer sidebar (looks like a document with a +)
- Or press `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (Mac)
- Or right-click in the Explorer sidebar and select **New File**

### Opening the Terminal
- Press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key) on Windows/Linux
- Press `` Cmd+` `` on Mac
- Or go to **Terminal → New Terminal** from the menu

### Useful Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Open Command Palette | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | `Cmd+Shift+P` |
| Save File | `Ctrl+S` | `Cmd+S` |
| Find in File | `Ctrl+F` | `Cmd+F` |
| Find in All Files | `Ctrl+Shift+F` | `Cmd+Shift+F` |
| Go to Line | `Ctrl+G` | `Cmd+G` |
| Toggle Terminal | `` Ctrl+` `` | `` Cmd+` `` |
| Split Editor | `Ctrl+\` | `Cmd+\` |
| Close Tab | `Ctrl+W` | `Cmd+W` |

### Command Palette
The Command Palette is your best friend! Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open it. From here you can:
- Install extensions
- Change themes
- Run commands
- Navigate files
- And much more!

## 🔌 Extensions

Extensions add extra functionality to VS Code.

### How to Install Extensions
1. Click the **Extensions** icon in the sidebar (looks like four squares)
2. Search for the extension name
3. Click **Install**

### Useful Extensions
These give you IntelliSense (autocompletion) while you code.

- [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
- [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

## The New Standard (AI-Native Editors)

In a hackathon, speed is your most valuable resource. These are standalone editors that are VS Code under the hood (same extensions, same hotkeys), but they have AI baked into the engine. They both offer **Tab Autocomplete** (predicting your next edit) and **Agents** (chatbots that know your codebase).

## 💡 Tips for Hackathons

1. **Use the integrated terminal** - No need to switch between windows!
2. **Split your editor** - View multiple files side-by-side (`Ctrl+\` or `Cmd+\`)
3. **Customize your theme** - Go to **File → Preferences → Color Theme** (or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`)
4. **Enable auto-save** - Go to **File → Auto Save** to never lose your work
5. **Use IntelliSense** - VS Code will suggest code completions as you type (press `Ctrl+Space` to trigger manually)

## 🆘 Getting Help

- **VS Code Documentation**: [code.visualstudio.com/docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Reference**: Press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+K Cmd+S` on Mac)
- **Ask mentors** - Don't hesitate to ask for help during the hackathon!

Happy coding! 🚀
